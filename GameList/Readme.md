# SteamRIP Py Launcher

SteamRIP Py Launcher is a simple Python script designed to scrape data from SteamRIP, allowing users to search for and download games via a Python-based GUI. The script automates downloading and extracting files for convenience.

## Features
- **Search and Download**: Easily find and download games directly through the GUI.
- **Automation**: Automatically handles downloading and extracting files to streamline the process.
- **Custom Use Case**: Primarily developed for personal use, such as managing portable hard drive game libraries.

## Future Plans
While the script is currently focused on its core functionality, I plan to evolve it into a more comprehensive game launcher, similar to platforms like Steam, where you can download games and maintain your library.

## Usage
1. **Setup**: Run the Python script to launch the GUI.
2. **Captcha Handling**:  
   - To bypass Cloudflare and the download captcha, you will need to solve captchas.
   - Integrate with [2Captcha](https://2captcha.com/) to automate captcha solving. By working as a solver on 2Captcha, you can earn free credits and use them to bypass the captchas seamlessly.

## Why I Built This
I download many games to portable hard drives and wanted an efficient tool to automate this process while providing a useful personal launcher. Sharing it here in case others find it helpful!
